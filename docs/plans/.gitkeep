# Implementation Plans

This directory contains design documents and implementation plans:

- Design documents: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Implementation plans: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md`

Plans are created using the Obra Superpowers workflow:
1. BRAINSTORM → design document
2. WRITE PLAN → implementation plan
3. EXECUTE PLAN → working code

Plans are versioned in git alongside the code they describe.
